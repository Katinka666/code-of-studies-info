## About the question database

I used 40 questions for testing my application, each referred by it's index in range of 0-39.

- **0-9**: The Code of Studies contains the answer explicitly.
- **10-19**: The Code of Studies contains the answer, but in several different places.
- **20-29**: The answer is not in the text, but can be deduced.
- **30-39**: The answer is not in the text and cannot be deduced.
