The dual training programme involves a bachelor or master programme that includes extensive practical training in fields such as technology, information technology, agriculture, science, economics, or social work. This programme is delivered according to a curriculum developed in line with the programme and outcome requirements for full-time studies. It includes specific provisions for the academic term, methods of training, contact hours, and the assessment of acquired knowledge and skills. The practical training is conducted within a framework set by the Council for Dual Education and takes place at qualified organisations. The organisation of dual programmes is determined by the rector in consultation with the University Studentsâ€™ Representation and the chancellor. This training approach allows students to gain hands-on experience in their field of study while fulfilling academic requirements.
