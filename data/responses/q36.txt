Based on the extract from the university's code of studies, it is not explicitly stated whether oral exams or written exams are more typical in general. However, it is mentioned that complex exams, which are required for the conclusion of the training and research phase for admission to the research and dissertation phase, are specifically oral exams. This suggests that, at least for complex exams, oral assessments play a significant role. For other types of exams, assessments can be oral, written, or a combination of several types, and the specifics depend on the subject requirements. Therefore, while oral exams are notable for complex exams, there isn't enough information to conclusively determine which type of exam is more typical overall.
