No, you do not only have to take a final examination at the end of the BSc course. The final examination is a requirement for obtaining the degree certificate in bachelor, master, single-cycle, and postgraduate specialist training programmes. It includes various parts such as defending the bachelor or master thesis, exams per subject or subject group, as well as final comprehensive examinations. Students must also meet certain criteria to be eligible to take the final examination, such as obtaining their leaving certificate and meeting any payment obligations to the university. Additionally, if a student fails to settle their payment obligations, return university-owned equipment, or submit their thesis on time, they may not be allowed to take their final exams.
