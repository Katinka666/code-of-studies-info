The preliminary course schedule refers to the arrangement of courses, including their time slots and instructors, as recorded in the university's system before the start of the term. This schedule is established to ensure that students can fulfill their subject requirements according to the recommended curriculum.

The schedule must generally be followed to allow all students to meet their academic requirements. However, deviations are possible under specific circumstances. For instance, preferential course schedules can be requested based on criteria such as outstanding academic performance, participation in exchange or mobility programs, elite sports participation, or personal circumstances like childbirth and health issues. These adjustments are made to accommodate the individual needs of students while ensuring they can complete their studies effectively.
