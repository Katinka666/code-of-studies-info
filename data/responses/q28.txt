If you have forgotten your password for the SAS, it could be a problem, as the SAS is the primary means of handling matters relating to student status and studies electronically at the university. However, the university provides alternative means of communication and submission in certain situations. You can contact the relevant university body or submit applications via email with electronic authentication if you do not have access to the SAS. It would be advisable to reset your password or contact the university's IT support to regain access to the SAS, as it is an important tool for managing your academic matters.
