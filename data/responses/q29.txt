If you do not pay for your second retake exam, you will likely not be allowed to participate in it. According to the university's code of studies, a second retake or repeat completion of summative assessments is subject to a special charge. Failing to pay this charge means you would not meet the requirements to register for and take the exam. As a result, you wouldn't have the opportunity to improve your grade through this second retake.
