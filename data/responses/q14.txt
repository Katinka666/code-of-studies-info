Based on the extract from the university's code of studies, exam papers generated during the exam period must be retained by the subject coordinator and are not returned to students. This means you cannot get your exam paper back after it has been corrected. However, you are allowed to review corrected and graded written assessments until the end of the examination period. Regarding using the exam paper as an aid for your next exam, the code does not permit keeping the exam paper, so you would not be able to use it as an aid in your next exam.
