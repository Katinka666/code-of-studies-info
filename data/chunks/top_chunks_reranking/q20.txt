Mid-term, exam or complex exam grades or results including the results of every assessment, except for diagnostic assessments, proposed grades, grades of part of an exam, the result of an oral exam or exam component not evaluated with a grade independently may be disclosed to students in person or in any other manner provided that they do no become known to third parties. 
[Exams] Exams are a form of assessment of achievement of specific learning outcomes related to a single subject, completed – in whole or in part – in the exam period. Exams may comprise an oral assessment, a written assessment, the completion of practical exercises, the complete or partial inclusion of the results of mid-term assessments of academic achievement or of a group of such assessments or the combination of any of the above parts. Exams may be single or combined. Single exams include only one while combined exams include at least two of the parts defined in subsection (2). The subject requirement defines which parts from subsection (2) will be included in a specific combined exam, with the restriction that the number of exam components and parts of an exam may not exceed three, the order in which the parts are required to be completed, what minimum performance criteria in each part are required to successfully pass the exam, how specific groups of interim assessments of achievement will be included in the exam result and if specific parts are allowed to be separately retaken or repeated with the purpose to improve the result. All parts of a combined exam are required to be completed in the same term, however specific parts may be completed on different days. An exam failed for any reason – including any failed part of an exam with the exception of the part in point d) of subsection (2) – reduces the number of exams available to a student by one. In case of the partial inclusion of mid-term results, the part of an exam taken during the exam period will be incorporated in the exam grade minimally at a rate of fifty per cent and the results achieved in the study period incorporated in the exam grade – unless otherwise specified in the subject requirement – will be incorporated in all terms for which a ‘Signed’ mark has been granted. The complete inclusion of mid-term results means that the exam grade is entirely based on a student’s interim achievements. In such cases, students will be allowed to modify the grade received in the above described manner in an exam taken in the exam period as specified by the subject requirement. 
Mid-term exam: every written summative type of the evaluation of learning outcomes which is taken in a controlled environment under the supervision of an instructor with a completion time frame of 30 minutes or more. Closed-system electronic online learning: Section 108 (49) of the Higher Education Act.: a form of teaching in which the theoretical material is taught using digital course material and the cooperation between the lecturer and the student is implemented by means of a closed online learning management system via an IT network (Internet, intranet), where the common means of communication between the lecturer, the administrator of the programme and the student or trainee are the computer, the IT network, the closed online learning management system and the study administration system; Closed online learning management system: Section 108 (50) of the Higher Education Act.: a qualified and certified closed IT system used for planning, organising and monitoring the training programme of a student, delivering the digital learning material and additional material required for such training (displayed in a web browser) according to the training programme, which, in addition to education management,  is used to record and evaluate the student's progress, their answers to test questions, results and activities in its database in a non-manipulable manner, and to implement possible navigation requests according to the training programme, based on the student's assessment, and ensure full on-line and off-line cooperation between the lecturer, the administrator of the programme and the student through interactive and online contact.
