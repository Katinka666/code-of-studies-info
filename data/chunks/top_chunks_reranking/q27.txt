[General rules of course registration] Preferential and preliminary subject and course registration is not compulsory for students, and during the finalisation period they may register courses which they did not register for during the preferential or preliminary periods. A student may only register for a subject or course if the requirements for its registration are fulfilled or when the Credit Transfer Committee has acknowledged the completion of the requirements based on the student's request. The course registration requirement as provided for in Section 36. (2) may be modified by the start of the preferential course registration period at the latest with the FSC's consent. Registration for a subject or course announced in order to complete a comprehensive exam or withdrawing such a registration may take place continuously until the end of the twelfth week of instruction at the latest irrespective of the subject and course registration periods. 
Gradual roll-out: a principle in education, which means that any new or revised academic or exam requirements may only be required to be fulfilled by students who started their studies after the introduction of such requirements or who started their studies before the introduction of such requirements but choose to comply with the new or revised academic and exam requirements at their discretion; Remedial course: a course of a compulsory subject based on the recommended curriculum – allowing the completion of the subject –, available to students who have failed to complete the subject when they previously registered for it. Remedial courses use specific teaching methodology; Remedial subject: a criterion requirement or optional subject with no credit value or in absence of those, a contact lesson offered as a study opportunity, primarily designed to cancel the gap in competences and skills acquired in the secondary school; Prerequisite subject: a subject to be completed by students admitted to a master training programme if their qualification obtained in a bachelor training programme may not be fully considered with its complete credit value for the specific master training programme; Student’s legal status: legal relationship between the student and the university, established with the enrolment, to which certain rights and obligations are attached; Student’s study contract: subsection (8) Section 108 of the Higher Education Act: contract concluded between the institution of higher education and the student accepted to a fee-paying programme in accordance with Section 39(3) of the Higher Education Act; 20a. Third party: a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data; Assessment of the student’s knowledge: obligatory evaluation of the learning outcomes of students admitted to a bachelor training programme or a single-cycle training programme, organised in the term of their admission, during which the University tests the competencies acquired in secondary education; 
If there are students on the waiting list for a course, for a compulsory subject in a particular term in the recommended curriculum, registration for the courses for that subject must be made possible for all students for whom this is required by the recommended curriculum either by raising the number of places on the courses or by starting a new course or courses, for compulsory elective subjects or elective subjects, the educational organisational unit may decide at its own discretion either to raise the number of places on the courses or to start new courses. Students may be transferred from the waiting list for a course to the actually admitted students based on previously given ranking criteria or, in the absence of these, based on the order of application. After the finalisation period, on the first working day of the first week of instruction, the study administrator of the educational organisational unit will delete  the course and subject applications of students on the waiting lists for the started courses; the applications of students for subjects and courses with a parallel prerequisite where the parallel prerequisite is not fulfilled; and the exam course applications of students without valid signature – subject to subsections (7)-(8) of Section 235.  After the registration period the educational organisational unit may only transfer a student to another course at the student's written request with the joint consent of the subject coordinator and the course instructors. Prior to the registration period, the educational organisational unit must announce the schedule of the laboratory practice in a manner to ensure that students are able to apply for the actual course in the SAS (direct application). If the course registration fails to be performed in the direct manner defined in subsection (10), the educational organisational unit registers the student for the required course following the registration period. Prior to such registration, the student must be notified via the SAS. Such registration must not cause students to have multiple courses at the same time.
