Laboratory practice, due to its nature, may also be held at a location other than that indicated in the timetable provided the students concerned are notified in advance. A lesson at the University is forty-five minutes and the breaks between lessons are fifteen minutes long. Provided the instructor and students agree, lessons may be held back-to-back and the breaks between them may also be taken consecutively. No more than two lessons may be held consecutively except for laboratory practices where the nature of the work processes requires more consecutive lessons.
