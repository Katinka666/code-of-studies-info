Failed first or repeated retake exams in a subject cannot be repeated within fifteen days of the failed exam.
If a combined type complex exam results in a fail, only the unsuccessful part is required to be retaken while the result of the successful part of the exam remains valid for a period of thirty days or not longer than the end of the term.
An exam failed for any reason – including any failed part of an exam with the exception of the part in point d) of subsection (2) – reduces the number of exams available to a student by one.
