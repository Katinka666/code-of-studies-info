For doctoral programmes, the enrolment process may be different from the provision of subsection (4) of Section 176 and the enrolment may be deferred by maximum one year at the reasonable request of the applicant.
Enrolment must take place by the end of the registration period unless the faculty responsible for the programme sets a different date due to the specific nature of the programme in question.
This process requires the direct involvement of the competent data controller organisation and becomes final after the verification of the enrolment form.
