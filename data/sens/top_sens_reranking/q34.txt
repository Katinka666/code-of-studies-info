Students may raise complaints with instructors, examiners, subject administrators – in special cases – heads of the department until the last day of the examination period.
In a state of emergency – within the framework of the temporary regulation issued by the Rector – the dean may, at the request of the lecturer, authorize or compulsorily prescribe the retention of certain study activities in the form of distance education.
Examinations may be held primarily on the premises of the University, but with the permission of the dean of the faculty responsible for the course (programme), they may be taken outside the premises.
