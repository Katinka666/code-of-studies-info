The educational organisational unit must allow access to a second retake or repeat completion if less than two-thirds of the students participating in the previous summative assessments earned a ‘Signed’ mark or a mid-term grade better than fail.
The provisions included in Title 34, regarding retakes and repeats shall be used for the first time for the 2nd term of the 2016/2017 academic year.
The opportunities for retakes, repeat or late completion related to mid-term assessments will be planned to ensure that students using the opportunities in subsections (1) to (5) of Section 122. and meeting the required criteria may receive a different grade than fail as their mid-term grade and/or may receive a ‘Signed’ mark in subjects concluded with an exam.
