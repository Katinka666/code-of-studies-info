The registration for active term will be invalid if based on information provided by the Higher Education Information System (hereinafter referred to as ‘HEIS’) prior to or at the beginning of the term (due to the expiry of the individual financing period or financing period defined for an academic programme), students transferred to a fee-paying programme fail to verify the continuation of their studies in a self-financing scheme – by signing a student’s study contract – until the end of the registration period.
If registration for an active term is withdrawn, that term will be classified as a passive term.
(3a) A student may not register for an active term if at the time of enrolment they presented a certificate of qualification with a limited period of validity [subsection (1) of Section 56], which has already expired.
