In case of oral assessments, a third person will be present apart from the student and the instructor conducting the assessment who may be a student or an instructor.
Oral assessments – as allowed by the venue of the assessment – may be attended by the University’s instructors and students, however, based on the student’s explicit and reasonable request, public attendance may be restricted by the instructor in case of an assessment and by the chair of the board of examiners in case of a complex exam or final exam.
If at least two-thirds of the students (at least 10 persons) taking the oral (part) exam on the same exam date of a subject announced for a term based on the recommended curriculum – not including repeat and retake (part) exams – fail, this must be investigated, initiated in writing by the Faculty Students’ Union or the head or instructor of the concerned educational organisational unit, within three days following the publication of the results.
