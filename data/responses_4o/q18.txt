No, the exam is not necessarily as long as the lesson. According to the provided extract, a lesson at the university is forty-five minutes long. However, the duration of a mid-term exam is defined only as being 30 minutes or more, without specifying a maximum duration. Therefore, an exam can be shorter or longer than a standard lesson, depending on its specific requirements.
