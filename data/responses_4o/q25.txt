Yes, there are negative consequences if you borrow a memory card (or any equipment) from the university and do not return it. According to the university's code of studies, students may not take their finals if they fail to return any equipment owned by the university that was previously given to them for use. Therefore, not returning the memory card could prevent you from completing your examinations, which could significantly impact your academic progress.
