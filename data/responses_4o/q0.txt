To earn credits for doctoral studies, you need to complete both coursework and research components. Specifically, you need:

- A minimum of 30 and a maximum of 50 credits for acquiring course material.
- A minimum of 130 and a maximum of 150 credits for scientific research, artistic activities, or guided tutoring.

Within these requirements, a maximum of 30 credits can be earned specifically for tutoring, and up to 30 credits can be recognized for writing the doctoral thesis as part of the scientific research component, subject to the supervisor's decision.

In total, you need to earn 240 credits in the doctoral programme. Note that a maximum of 45 credits may be collected per term, except during the research and dissertation phase, where up to 60 credits may be earned per term.
