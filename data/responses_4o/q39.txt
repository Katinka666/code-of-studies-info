Based on the extract provided, the allocation of credits to courses, including those taught in German, is determined by the curriculum set by the university. Credits are allocated based on the study requirements and the number of study hours associated with each subject. One credit typically corresponds to thirty study hours. Therefore, lessons in German would not automatically receive more credits unless the curriculum specifies that they require more study hours compared to other subjects. The credit allocation is standardized and applies uniformly across subjects unless specifically noted otherwise in the curriculum.
