Based on the extract from the university's code of studies, there are no explicit mentions regarding the grading process in courses like Probability or any specific rules or guidelines that would suggest that everyone receiving an A in Probability is inherently suspicious. The document primarily discusses confidentiality, payment obligations, document accessibility, admission and transfer processes, and the equivalence of grades from ECTS to the university's grading system.

However, if students have concerns about fairness or transparency in grading, they might consider whether there is any evidence that the grading violated the university's procedures. For instance, if there was a belief that the decision-making process in determining grades was "abnormally unreasonable, contrary to the rules of logic, or they were disregarded," an appeal could potentially be considered under those circumstances. 

Without more information on the specific grading process for the Probability course, it's not possible to definitively determine if there is anything suspicious. It might be worthwhile to inquire further with the department or a faculty member if there are concerns about transparency
