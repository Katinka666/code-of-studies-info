Based on the extracts from the university's code of studies, the instructor cannot make it compulsory to attend eighty per cent of the classes in exchange for not having a third party present at the oral exam. The presence of a third person at oral assessments is a requirement specified in the code, and it states that a third person, who may be a student or an instructor, will be present. The student's explicit and reasonable request can restrict public attendance, but this does not affect the presence of the third person during the oral assessment. Attendance requirements are related to obtaining credits for the subject rather than altering the conditions of oral assessments. Therefore, the instructor cannot use attendance as leverage to change the rules regarding the presence of a third party at oral exams.
