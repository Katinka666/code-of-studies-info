The provided extract from the university's code of studies does not directly address whether yelling is allowed on campus. It primarily covers procedures for applicant participation, communication methods, and educational organization formats, especially in relation to emergencies and distance education.

To determine if yelling is permitted on campus, you would need to consult the university's rules of conduct or student code of behavior, which would typically cover acceptable behavior, noise levels, and respect for the campus environment. Without specific information from such a document, I cannot definitively say whether yelling is allowed or prohibited on campus.
