Professors are obligated to provide a second retake for a midterm if less than two-thirds of the students participating in the previous summative assessments earned a 'Signed' mark or a mid-term grade better than fail. This second retake is organized as defined in the relevant section of the code and must be completed by the third day of the exam period. Students are only eligible to participate in the second retake if they have participated in the initial assessment or its first retake, repeat, or late completion.
