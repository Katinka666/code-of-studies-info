The university's code of studies outlines several rules and expectations that might contribute to your perception of the Physics teacher as being annoying. Here are a few potential reasons based on the extract:

1. **Strict Adherence to Schedule**: The code requires lessons to be conducted at specific times and places, and this might make your teacher seem inflexible or rigid if they strictly enforce these rules.

2. **Attendance and Punctuality**: The code emphasizes the importance of attendance, especially for laboratory practices. If your Physics teacher enforces penalties for lateness or absence, this could be perceived as annoying.

3. **Continuous Supervision**: The requirement for continuous supervision during lessons might make your teacher seem overly watchful or controlling, as they are obligated to ensure the lesson is conducted properly.

4. **Length of Lessons**: The code allows for lessons to be held consecutively with breaks taken later, which might lead to longer class periods that feel tiring or overwhelming.
