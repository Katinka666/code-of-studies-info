I'm sorry, but the extract provided does not specify the number of credits allocated to Maths-related subjects. The allocation of credits to specific subjects, including Maths-related ones, would typically be part of the individual curriculum for each program, which is not included in the text provided. You would need to refer to the specific curriculum or course catalog of your program to find the exact credit allocation for Maths-related subjects.
