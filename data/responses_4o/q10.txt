In a doctoral programme, a maximum of 45 credits can be earned per term (semester) during the training and research phase, and up to 60 credits during the research and dissertation phase. The document does not specify the exact number of hours per semester, as this can vary based on individual work schedules and the nature of the activities involved (such as research, coursework, and tutoring). However, the focus is on credit accrual, with the maximum being 45 or 60 credits per term, depending on the phase of the programme.
