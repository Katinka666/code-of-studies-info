The information provided is an extract from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) Code of Studies, which outlines the structure, governance, and examination procedures at BME. It does not provide a basis for comparing BME with another university, such as Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE). Determining which university is "better" would depend on various factors including academic programs, faculty, resources, campus life, and personal preferences, none of which are addressed in the provided document. It is advisable for students to consider their specific academic interests, career goals, and personal priorities when evaluating universities. Additionally, they may want to seek out other resources or speak to current students or alumni from both BME and ELTE for a more comprehensive comparison.
