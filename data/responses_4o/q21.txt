If you fall ill and cannot take the second retake exam, it appears that participation in second retakes or repeat completions of summative assessments is contingent on having participated in the assessment or its first retake, repeat, or late completion. The code does not explicitly mention provisions for illness preventing attendance of a second retake. However, it would be prudent to notify and discuss your situation with the head of the educational organisational unit responsible for the subject or the dean of the faculty to explore any possible options, such as rescheduling due to exceptional circumstances like illness. It is important to provide reasonable explanation and, if possible, documentation of your illness when making such a request.
