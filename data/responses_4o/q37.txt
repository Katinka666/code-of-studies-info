To log into the Study Administration System (SAS), you would typically need to use your university credentials, which might include your student identification number and a password. If you are a new student or have not yet set up your login details, you may need to follow the university's specific process for creating or retrieving your login information, which could involve verifying your identity through electronic authentication or contacting the university's IT support for assistance. If you do not have access to the SAS, you should be able to submit applications electronically through email with digital authentication, but for accessing the system itself, you will need to ensure your login credentials are set up and functioning.
