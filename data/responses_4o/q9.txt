If you forget to register for an active term, you will be automatically registered as having a passive term, and your legal status as a student will be suspended for that term. This means you would not be able to participate in courses or university activities typically available to active students. However, you may request retrospective activation of the term if you apply by the end of the second week of instruction and meet all conditions for registering for the active term. This activation may incur a fee. If you had a legitimate unforeseen reason for not registering, such as illness or an accident, you might request to withdraw registration retroactively, subject to approval and appropriate documentation.
