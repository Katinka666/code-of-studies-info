Yes, there is a provision for a second retake midterm exam for each subject, provided that certain conditions are met. Specifically, the educational organisational unit must allow access to a second retake if less than two-thirds of the students participating in the previous summative assessments earned a ‘Signed’ mark or a mid-term grade better than fail. Additionally, students must have participated in the initial assessment or its first retake to be eligible for the second retake.

Regarding the scheduling of the second retake, it needs to be completed by the third day of the exam period. The retake exams are organized in this manner, which implies that they cannot be held the day after the first retake midterm exam, unless that day falls within the period ending on the third day of the exam period.
