Based on the university's code of studies, classes for full-time programmes are to be organised between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on working days. However, evening programmes, which are part of part-time study options, can have classes between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on working days and on Saturdays.

Therefore, there can be classes after 9 p.m. if they are part of an evening programme, which can extend until 10 p.m. on working days or Saturdays. However, full-time programmes must conclude by 8 p.m. unless there is an agreement with the University Studentsâ€™ Representation for a deviation from this schedule.
