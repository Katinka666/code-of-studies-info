The late completion period is after the study period and is separate from the exam period. The text specifies that the late completion period is a designated time for retaking or repeating evaluations completed during the study period, and it is at least five working days long. Additionally, it mentions that a late completion period and an exam period may share at most one working day in common, which reinforces that they are distinct periods with limited overlap.
