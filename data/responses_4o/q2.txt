Yes, you can ask to be dismissed at your own request if you are transferred to a self-pay course. According to the university's code of studies, a student's legal status can be terminated upon the student's own request by giving written notice. This applies regardless of whether you are transferring to a self-pay course, as long as you provide the necessary written notification expressing your wish to terminate your student status.
