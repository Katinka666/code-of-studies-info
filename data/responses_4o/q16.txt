Based on the provided extract from the university's code of studies, you can request a transfer to a self-paid (self-financed) course. The transfer procedure outlined allows you to change the financing form of your training, which includes the possibility of being reclassified to self-financed status if you were previously on a scholarship and withdrew your declaration. The process involves submitting a transfer request with the necessary documentation and following the guidelines for transfer within the specified periods.

The option to be "fired" or dismissed from the university is not explicitly mentioned in the extract. Generally, dismissal from a university is not a request made by students but rather a decision made by the university based on certain criteria, such as academic performance or disciplinary actions. If you wish to leave the university, you might consider withdrawing or taking a leave of absence, but these options would depend on the university's policies, which are not detailed in the extract provided.
