You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Is the exam as long as the lesson?
[Course] The course or exam course is the form of a subject the way it appears in each term or academic year enabling students to fulfil the subject requirements. For subjects specified in Section 17 (2) a) , a course is a contact lesson with contact hours included in the timetable where the study process is completed through personal interaction between the student and the instructor (lecturer, practice leader, etc.) at regular intervals or through a longer period of time once or several times in a study period.  Subjects specified in Section 17 (2) b) or c) have no time and contact hours assigned to them in the timetable. Courses with contact hours can have the following types: lecture, practice or laboratory, drawing room or field practice (hereinafter referred to as ‘laboratory practice’). Courses can be of the following nature: autonomous course – a course that inherits only its goal from the subject for whose fulfilment it was announced but its content can be freely adjusted to the subject’s learning outcomes; or derived course – an exclusively practice- or laboratory practice-type course with the goal to reach the learning outcomes of the subject for which it was announced (this course does not have learning outcomes of its own); in terms of content, it is subordinated to the lecture-type course of the subject. Depending on its type, nature and content, a course can have timetable data, organisational unit, instructor, opportunities for the evaluation of learning outcomes, and qualification procedures assigned to it. Students have to be provided with an opportunity to consult about the course. An exam course is a course without contact hours not included in the timetable. An exam course can be one of the following: an act of study required to pass a comprehensive exam; an exam opportunity where a student can complete a subject with contact hours and concluded with an exam if they have a “Signed” entry for the given subject from an earlier term but have not yet completed the given subject even if no course(s) with contact hours were announced for it in the current term;  [Lesson] Contact lessons with a specific time in the timetable must be held within the framework of a lesson, under the continuous supervision of the instructor, and, apart from extraordinary cases, at the time and place indicated in the timetable. Laboratory practice, due to its nature, may also be held at a location other than that indicated in the timetable provided the students concerned are notified in advance. A lesson at the University is forty-five minutes and the breaks between lessons are fifteen minutes long. Provided the instructor and students agree, lessons may be held back-to-back and the breaks between them may also be taken consecutively. No more than two lessons may be held consecutively except for laboratory practices where the nature of the work processes requires more consecutive lessons.  Mid-term exam: every written summative type of the evaluation of learning outcomes which is taken in a controlled environment under the supervision of an instructor with a completion time frame of 30 minutes or more. Closed-system electronic online learning: Section 108 (49) of the Higher Education Act.: a form of teaching in which the theoretical material is taught using digital course material and the cooperation between the lecturer and the student is implemented by means of a closed online learning management system via an IT network (Internet, intranet), where the common means of communication between the lecturer, the administrator of the programme and the student or trainee are the computer, the IT network, the closed online learning management system and the study administration system; Closed online learning management system: Section 108 (50) of the Higher Education Act.: a qualified and certified closed IT system used for planning, organising and monitoring the training programme of a student, delivering the digital learning material and additional material required for such training (displayed in a web browser) according to the training programme, which, in addition to education management,  is used to record and evaluate the student's progress, their answers to test questions, results and activities in its database in a non-manipulable manner, and to implement possible navigation requests according to the training programme, based on the student's assessment, and ensure full on-line and off-line cooperation between the lecturer, the administrator of the programme and the student through interactive and online contact. Enacting and enabling provisions  A lesson at the University is forty-five minutes and the breaks between lessons are fifteen minutes long. Exam course also means the opportunity to complete a subject, granted by the curriculum, where a remedial criteria subject or a contact lesson, subject to completion with a mid-term grade or ex-am, to which the student registered in the previous term, but failed to complete it, can be completed by the student in a term when the contact class course is not launched; Mid-term exam: every written summative type of the evaluation of learning outcomes which is taken in a controlled environment under the supervision of an instructor with a completion time frame of 30 minutes or more. The duration of the training format under subsection (2)of Section 11.  is at least 20 and at most 50 per cent of the number of lessons in full-time programmes in each term.
