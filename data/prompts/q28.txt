You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: I forgot my password for the SAS, so I can't read it, is it a problem?
[Contact with the parties] The acting person or body shall contact the applicant and those involved in the case  via the SAS, by post, by electronic means (e.g. e-mail or other messaging service), in person, including over the telephone. Contact by the methods specified in points a) and b), subsection (1) shall be deemed written, while contact by the methods described in points c) and d) shall be deemed verbal. Unless stipulated otherwise by this Code, contact shall be made primarily via the SAS. Based on the legal stipulations, the University may use another form of contact. Verbal contact may be used in any case where written contact is not mandatory. Applicants shall be notified of the decisions in written form only.  Section 10/A [General rules on the electronic administration of studies] At the University, matters relating to student status and studies shall be handled electronically through the SAS, exceptionally, by internal regulation, in an information system other than the SAS. Unless otherwise provided by law or internal regulation, the data of documents and electronic forms submitted through the SAS shall be verified in advance free of charge and authenticated by the submitter free of charge using the Regulated Electronic Administration Services (hereinafter referred to as ’REAS’) and the Central Electronic Administration Services (hereinafter referred to as ’CEAS’). The following shall be authenticated in REAS or CEAS electronic copy of the exam sheet; electronic copy of the comprehensive exam report; electronic copy of the complex exam report; electronic copy of the final examination report; electronic copy of the bachelor (master) thesis; student’s statement submitted in the SAS other statements by the lecturer or student, related to the studies. The structure and the content of training programmes Training formats and study modes   [Verification of prerequisite] The prerequisites for a subject must also be completed by a student who wishes to register for a particular subject as the student of another programme. The Credit Transfer Committee may acknowledge that a subject set as a prerequisite is satisfied provided that the student has the learning outcomes expected in advance. The Dean's Office inspects the milestone type prerequisites which are published in the programme's educational programme and cannot be set in the SAS and deletes any subject or course registration which does not comply with the requirements by the end of the sixth week of the study period while simultaneously informing the student concerned. In the event that a subject with a prerequisite in the recommended curriculum which is incorrectly set in the SAS is completed, this will remain valid even if the prerequisite is not satisfied. Talent management  If the applicant does not have access to the SAS, the application must be submitted electronically (through email) with electronic authentication (digital authentication). Persons not having access to the SAS may submit a request for redress to the person or body acting in the first instance in electronic form (email). At the student's request submitted in the SAS, based on the FSC's decision, registration for a subject or course must be deleted if attendance at the course did not occur for a reason verifiably attributable to the University or the instructor.
