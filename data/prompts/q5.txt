You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Am I allowed to end my demonstrator status before the semester ends?
[The termination of a demonstrator’s legal status] If demonstrators neglect their studies and their responsibilities as demonstrators, fail to meet such responsibilities or demonstrate behaviour inappropriate for university students, the dean may terminate their demonstrator’s legal status, based on the recommendation of the head of the competent educational organisational unit. Demonstrators are allowed to terminate their demonstrator’s legal status pursuant to the provisions of the relevant agreement. Remuneration of demonstrators  [The establishment of a demonstrator’s legal status] A demonstrator’s legal status may only be established through a public application process. Only students in full-time bachelor, master or single-cycle trainings at the University are allowed to be engaged as demonstrators.  The call for applications must be announced in a manner to ensure that the applications are evaluated and the demonstrator’s legal status is established until the end of the first week of instruction. The application period must be at least eight days.  A demonstrator’s legal status may be established for one term based on one application, however it may be re-established for an unlimited number of times in case of any additional successful applications.  Calls for applications for demonstrators are announced and published by the dean on the faculty’s website.  Eligibility criteria for demonstrators include the following:  applicants must have active student’s legal status in the term for which the demonstrator’s legal status is established; applicants must have a degree obtained in a bachelor or single-cycle training programme; in absence of a degree obtained in a bachelor or single-cycle training programme, applicants must have at least twenty-five obtained credits per each closed active term and a cumulative weighted grade point average exceeding 3.50; and  applicants must not be subject to any disciplinary sanctions.  The maximum number of persons with a demonstrator’s legal status is determined by the dean with the restriction that the number of persons with a demonstrator’s legal status in each term may not exceed five per cent of the students taught by the faculty in full-time daytime training programmes, including the students of other faculties as well.   [The evaluation of demonstrator activities] Demonstrator activities are successful if evaluated as such by the head of the competent educational organisational unit. The head of the educational organisational unit informs the dean on the evaluation under subsection (1) within fifteen days following the end of the term. Successful demonstrator engagements must be recorded in the SAS, in the student register and the diploma supplement. Data related to demonstrator activities (date of the establishment of legal status, successful completion, unsuccessful completion) are recorded in the SAS by the student’s data controller, initiated by the competent faculty.   Demonstrators are allowed to terminate their demonstrator’s legal status pursuant to the provisions of the relevant agreement. Eligibility criteria for demonstrators include the following:  applicants must have active student’s legal status in the term for which the demonstrator’s legal status is established; applicants must have a degree obtained in a bachelor or single-cycle training programme; in absence of a degree obtained in a bachelor or single-cycle training programme, applicants must have at least twenty-five obtained credits per each closed active term and a cumulative weighted grade point average exceeding 3.50; and  applicants must not be subject to any disciplinary sanctions.
