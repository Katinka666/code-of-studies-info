You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Is the late completion period after the study period or the exam period?
 [Retakes, repeat or late completion of assessments of achievement conducted in the study period] Diagnostic assessments to monitor progress in the study period may only be completed in a delayed manner or retaken in combination with the academic activity whose performance requires its successful completion as specified by the subject requirement. In case of the group of formative assessments in the study period where the subject requirement specifically permits, late submission is allowed upon payment of an extra charge defined in this Code. At a minimum, one week will be allowed between the original and the late submission date. Late submission is allowed until the last day of the late completion period. The aspect of late submission may be considered in the evaluation of the assignment up to twenty per cent of the assignment’s value (score). ,Closed (submitted) formative assessments, if their type allows, may be repeatedly completed – free of charge – until the end of the late completion period by the repeated completion of the assessment or by its repeated submission in a corrected and extended format. A repeat completion is only allowed if it is permitted by the subject requirement and the completed or submitted assessment of achievement has previously been graded, as specified by the subject requirement including completion or submission in a timely manner. All students having enrolled the course have the right for a retake, repeat or late completion of all summative assessments completed in the study period one time and free of charge provided that they have met the attendance, participation requirements defined in the subject requirement and in this Code. The first (free of charge) retake or repeat performance assessments or summative assessments of the subjects announced according to the model curriculum in a given term, including summative assessments according to the model curriculum, may not be held on the same date. First retake, repeat or late completion of summative assessments in the study period will take place  independently for each assessment of achievement [individual retake, repeat or late completion] or in an aggregate manner for all assessments of achievement [combined retake, repeat or late completion] at retake, repeat or late completion occasions published for the study or late completion period. Individual retake, repeat or late completions cover the same body of knowledge and are based on the same methodology as the assessment of achievement retaken or completed after the due date. Combined retake, repeat or late completions are subject to the consent of the FSC responsible for the programme (training). If repeat or late completion of any groups of assessments of academic achievement is prohibited by any provision of the subject requirement, the (partial) result for these groups of assessments will be based on the most favourable two-third – rounded down – for the specific student. Late completion defined in point a) of subsection (5)will be held in the late completion period if it may not be scheduled for the study period due to the deadline specified in subsection (4)of Section 127. ,,If specifically allowed by the subject requirement, a retake, repeat or late completion of summative assessments is allowed for a second time upon payment of a special charge defined in this Code. Second retakes, repeat completions are organised as defined in subsection (5) and are required to be completed until the third day of the exam period. The educational organisational unit must allow access to a second retake or repeat completion if less than two-thirds of the students participating in the previous summative assessments earned a ‘Signed’ mark or a mid-term grade better than fail. Second retakes or repeat completions of summative assessments will be published via the SAS as special exam dates defined in other regulations and students must register for them according to the rules of exam registration. No grades, results will be recorded for exam dates published as described above. Students are only allowed to participate in second retakes or repeat completions of summative assessments if they have participated in the assessment or its first retake, repeat or late completion.  [Signatures] In case of subjects ending in an exam, students are required to obtain the ‘Signed’ mark until the end of the study period or the end of the late completion period at the latest to be able to register for an exam. In order to obtain a ‘Signed’ mark, students are required to fulfil the attendance, participation requirements defined in the subject requirement pursuant to this Code and the individual or aggregate results attained in their assessments of academic achievement will correspond to the level (points) defined in the subject requirement, which level (points) may not exceed fifty per cent of the level (points) earned by the full and correct completion of all assessments of achievement. If a student fails to meet the criteria to obtain a signature until the end of the study period, they will receive a ‘Denied’ mark.  Students receiving a ‘Denied’ mark at the end of the study period may attempt to obtain the ‘Signed’ mark – as specified by Title 34 of this Code – in the late completion period. The ‘Signed’ mark – unless otherwise specified in the subject requirement – will be valid throughout the entire duration of the studies conducted at the University, including their continuation by changing programmes or re-registration. Signatures determined in the subject requirements must be valid for at least two terms following the obtaining of such signatures. Rules regarding exams and complex exams  Dependent on the training and outcome requirements, the academic term consists of  a study period of at least fourteen weeks and at most seventy working days,  a late completion period of at least five working days, an exam period of at least twenty working days and a final examination period of at least ten working days, part of which is after the exam period. Late completion: the continuation of or the first attempt for a student to take a regular assessment of academic performance which was not started or was started but was not finished, for reasons not attributable to the student; Late completion period: period for retaking or repeating the evaluations of learning outcomes completed in the study period. A late completion period and exam period which consist of more than five working days may share at most one working day in common.
