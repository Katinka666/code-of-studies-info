You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Who needs more credits in total, the MSc student or the doctoral student?
A total of 180 credits shall be collected in the doctoral programme as follows: minimum 30 and maximum 50 credits for acquiring the course material, minimum 130 and maximum 150 credits for scientific research, artistic activities or guided tutoring. A maximum of 45 credits may be collected per term. Recognised credits are not included in this. The time spent on writing the doctoral thesis during the programme may be recognised as scientific research with a maximum of 30 credits based on the decision of the supervisor, who shall also evaluate (grade) this activity.  The academic performance and progress of the student shall be evaluated by the Doctoral School Council every academic year, based on the recommendation of the student’s supervisor. As a result of the evaluation, on the recommendation of the Doctoral School Council, students whose academic progress is unsatisfactory, but maximum 15% of students participating in the given programme supported by Hungarian state scholarships, may be reclassified by the dean to self-financed status. The vacancies, thus created in the state scholarship programme, may be filled by the dean by transferring students from the self-financed programme on the recommendation of the Doctoral School Council. Reclassification decisions are made by the dean at the end of every academic year, at least 30 days before the start of the next academic year. Students reclassified to state-funded programmes shall be eligible for doctoral student scholarships from the first month of the academic year after the reclassification. The student status of doctoral students shall be terminated if they fail to meet any of the following criteria: to earn minimum 20 credits by term, minimum 10 of which are credits for research, to earn minimum 50 credits in the first two active terms, minimum 25 of which are credits for research, to earn minimum 105 credits in the first four active terms, minimum 52 of which are credits for research. The student status of doctoral students may not be terminated if, based on the permission of the Doctoral Study Committee, they participate in part-time studies abroad for over 6 months, they conduct their research at a foreign university or research institute, broken into subtasks as agreed with their supervisor.  [Frameworks of the doctoral programmes] The enrolment shall be based on the student’s individual work schedule for every term, which shall be compiled according to the instructions of the Doctoral School. In the first active term, students shall submit their work schedule in consultation with their supervisors by the end of the third week of the term. In subsequent terms works schedules shall be submitted to the Dean’s Office by the end of the registration period. If a student fails to submit the work schedule by the deadline specified in subsection (1), they may remedy this by handing it in by the end of the fifth week of the term. Late submissions shall be subject to a fee set by the relevant rules of the University. If the work schedule is not submitted by this deadline for reasons attributable to the student, the term in question shall be classified as a passive term. Research and publication activities are subjects that are part of the doctoral programme, for which mid-term grades are given. The subject administrator for these shall be the supervisor. Mid-term grades are given by the supervisor. Guided tutoring may also be part of the training programme, where students work under the guidance of a designated lecturer to improve their presentation and communication skills by teaching in the form of contact hours, where they use a preliminarily prepared and well documented training material. Following consultation between the student, their supervisor or thesis advisor (in the case of an external supervisor), the subject is selected by the supervisor or by the head of the organisational unit (in the case of an external supervisor), and the performance is evaluated by the head of the organisational unit at the recommendation of the appointed lecturer. A maximum of 30 credits in total may be earned for tutoring during the doctoral programme. As specified by the curriculum of the Doctoral School, a total of 240 credits shall be collected in the doctoral programme. The curriculum shall be published by the Doctoral School on its own website or on the website of the faculty in charge of the programme, as well as the website of the Hungarian Doctoral Council.  In one term up to forty-five credits may be earned in the training and research phase and up to sixty in the research and dissertation phase. Recognised credits are not included in this. The time spent on writing the doctoral thesis during the programme may be recognised as scientific research with a maximum of 30 credits based on the decision of the supervisor, who shall also grade this activity. A student may also be enrolled in a doctoral programme by taking part in a preparatory course as part of the doctoral programme in parallel with the final academic year of their studies in a master programme, provided that they also fulfil the requirements for admission after obtaining the master's degree. At the time of the admission decision, the credits completed in the master programme and forming part of the doctoral programme shall be recognised pursuant to the University’s Code of Doctoral Studies and Habilitation. Rights, responsibilities and remuneration of doctoral students  A total of 180 credits shall be collected in the doctoral programme as follows: minimum 30 and maximum 50 credits for acquiring the course material, minimum 130 and maximum 150 credits for scientific research, artistic activities or guided tutoring. As specified by the curriculum of the Doctoral School, a total of 240 credits shall be collected in the doctoral programme. A maximum of 30 credits in total may be earned for tutoring during the doctoral programme.
