You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Which university is better, BME or ELTE?
[Subject code] Subjects are unambiguously identified by a subject code. Subject codes are a series of symbols of eleven characters including exclusively digits and letters. The first three characters of a subject code  are ‘BME’, the fourth and fifth characters are the two-letter code of the faculty in charge of the subject (EO – Faculty of Civil Engineering, GE – Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, EP – Faculty of Architecture, VE – Faculty of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, VI – Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, KO – Faculty of Transportation Engineering and Vehicle Engineering, TE – Faculty of Natural Sciences, GT – Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences), the sixth and seventh characters identify the educational organisational unit assigned by the faculty in charge of the programme (training), the eighth character identifies the level of training (A to L, not including D – bachelor programme, M, N, P and Q – master and single-cycle programme, T or S – postgraduate specialist training programme, D – doctoral training, U – advanced level subject in a bachelor programme, V – advanced level subject in a master programme, X – remedial subject in a bachelor programme, Y – remedial subject in a master programme, R, W and Z – reserved for other purposes), if not regulated by the faculty, the ninth, tenth and eleventh characters are given by the subject coordinator.  [Purpose and principles of the Code] The Code of Studies and Exams (hereinafter referred to as ‘Code’) aims to regulate the rights and obligations of students, instructors and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (hereinafter referred to as ‘University’) arising from the student’s legal status; set uniform organisational and governance procedures for the actors of education; help create and maintain the set of conditions and the institutional framework required for sharing and acquiring competitive knowledge. This Code can be cited as the ‘BME CoS’. During the procedure the acting body or person takes into account the facts regarding the case concerned, evaluates all evidence in accordance with its due weight, and establishes its decision on true facts. To improve efficiency, decision making persons or bodies are required to organise their activities to ensure that the procedure is closed in the shortest possible time, without compromising the requirements to reveal the facts and using advanced technologies. Parties affected by academic and exam matters are allowed to make a statement, remark any time in the course of the procedure. In exercising rights and fulfilling obligations, as laid down by the present Code, the parties concerned shall carry out their actions in accordance with the principles of good faith, fair dealing and obligation of cooperation.  The requirements of good faith and fair dealing shall be considered breached where a party’s exercise of rights is contradictory to his previous actions which the other party had reason to rely on. The parties concerned may not conduct themselves in such a manner as to mislead the acting person or body or cause an unjustifiable delay in decision-making or enforcement. The parties concerned shall be presumed to act in good faith, the burden of proof for bad faith lies with the acting body or person. Unless otherwise provided for by this Code, in exercising rights and fulfilling obligations, what can be expected of or by a person, or in a particular situation, is a reference to what can reasonably be expected.  [Result of the final examination] The results of the final examinations (RFE) are calculated as follows: 0.5AGS+0.5T, where AGS is the average of the grades of the subjects of the final examinations and T is the grade given for the bachelor or master thesis. The final examination is unsuccessful and the RFE is zero if any of the grades given at the final examination is a fail.  The first three characters of a subject code  are ‘BME’, the fourth and fifth characters are the two-letter code of the faculty in charge of the subject (EO – Faculty of Civil Engineering, GE – Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, EP – Faculty of Architecture, VE – Faculty of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, VI – Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, KO – Faculty of Transportation Engineering and Vehicle Engineering, TE – Faculty of Natural Sciences, GT – Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences), the sixth and seventh characters identify the educational organisational unit assigned by the faculty in charge of the programme (training), the eighth character identifies the level of training (A to L, not including D – bachelor programme, M, N, P and Q – master and single-cycle programme, T or S – postgraduate specialist training programme, D – doctoral training, U – advanced level subject in a bachelor programme, V – advanced level subject in a master programme, X – remedial subject in a bachelor programme, Y – remedial subject in a master programme, R, W and Z – reserved for other purposes), if not regulated by the faculty, the ninth, tenth and eleventh characters are given by the subject coordinator. Finals may be organised jointly by EOUs, including the EOUs of other institution of higher educations, based on their agreement. If the programme does not have a specialisation, the finals will be organised by the EOU announcing the bachelor or master thesis topic.
