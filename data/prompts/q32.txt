You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Why is the Physics teacher so annoying?
    [Lesson] Contact lessons with a specific time in the timetable must be held within the framework of a lesson, under the continuous supervision of the instructor, and, apart from extraordinary cases, at the time and place indicated in the timetable. Laboratory practice, due to its nature, may also be held at a location other than that indicated in the timetable provided the students concerned are notified in advance. A lesson at the University is forty-five minutes and the breaks between lessons are fifteen minutes long. Provided the instructor and students agree, lessons may be held back-to-back and the breaks between them may also be taken consecutively. No more than two lessons may be held consecutively except for laboratory practices where the nature of the work processes requires more consecutive lessons.  If absence from the total number of practical and laboratory practice lessons exceeds thirty per cent, the credits for the subject cannot be obtained. In laboratory practice, the course instructor may refuse to allow students who arrive late to attend. Students may only have one grade entered for a term in a subject evaluated with a mid-term grade; grades obtained or modified by a retake, repeat or late completion erase the previous grade.
