You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Is it more typical to have an oral exam or a written exam?
[Exams] Exams are a form of assessment of achievement of specific learning outcomes related to a single subject, completed – in whole or in part – in the exam period. Exams may comprise an oral assessment, a written assessment, the completion of practical exercises, the complete or partial inclusion of the results of mid-term assessments of academic achievement or of a group of such assessments or the combination of any of the above parts. Exams may be single or combined. Single exams include only one while combined exams include at least two of the parts defined in subsection (2). The subject requirement defines which parts from subsection (2) will be included in a specific combined exam, with the restriction that the number of exam components and parts of an exam may not exceed three, the order in which the parts are required to be completed, what minimum performance criteria in each part are required to successfully pass the exam, how specific groups of interim assessments of achievement will be included in the exam result and if specific parts are allowed to be separately retaken or repeated with the purpose to improve the result. All parts of a combined exam are required to be completed in the same term, however specific parts may be completed on different days. An exam failed for any reason – including any failed part of an exam with the exception of the part in point d) of subsection (2) – reduces the number of exams available to a student by one. In case of the partial inclusion of mid-term results, the part of an exam taken during the exam period will be incorporated in the exam grade minimally at a rate of fifty per cent and the results achieved in the study period incorporated in the exam grade – unless otherwise specified in the subject requirement – will be incorporated in all terms for which a ‘Signed’ mark has been granted. The complete inclusion of mid-term results means that the exam grade is entirely based on a student’s interim achievements. In such cases, students will be allowed to modify the grade received in the above described manner in an exam taken in the exam period as specified by the subject requirement.  the result of the written exam (if any), questions asked in the oral exam (if any) and the evaluation of the oral exam, the final grade of the complex exam, and the handwritten or electronic signatures of the members of the complex exam board.  [Complex exam] A successful complex exam is required for the conclusion of the training and research phase and for admission to the research and dissertation phase.  Complex exams are oral exams, consisting of parts specified by subsection (3)–(5) of Section 14/B. of the Code of Doctoral Studies and Habilitation.  Exams may comprise an oral assessment, a written assessment, the completion of practical exercises, the complete or partial inclusion of the results of mid-term assessments of academic achievement or of a group of such assessments or the combination of any of the above parts. Complex exams are oral exams, consisting of parts specified by subsection (3)–(5) of Section 14/B. The oral part of a complex exam will be taken in the presence of a board of examiners including at least two members.
