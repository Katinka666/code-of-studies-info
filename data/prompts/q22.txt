You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Can there be classes after 9 pm?
[Work order of programmes] Programmes under Section 11. may be organised in full-time (daytime), part-time (evening or correspondence), or distance learning format.  Full-time programmes must include at least 200 contact lessons (for doctoral studies at least 40 contact lessons) or the equivalent of closed-system online learning every term. Full-time programmes must be organised between 8 a.m and 8 p.m. on working days during weeks including 5 school-days weekly. Deviation from this provision is allowed subject to the agreement of the University Students’ Representation. Full-time programmes may also be offered as dual or cooperative programmes. The criteria regarding the organisation of dual programmes are determined by the rector, in agreement with the University Students’ Representation and the chancellor and the criteria regarding cooperative programmes are determined by the dean of the faculty in charge of the academic programme, in agreement with the programme owner and the Faculty Students’ Representation, in an order. The duration of part-time programmes – not including the training format under subsection (2)of Section 11. – is at least 30 and at most 50 per cent of the number of lessons in full-time programmes in each term. The duration of distance learning programmes must not exceed 30 per cent of the number of lessons in full-time programmes in each term. The duration of the training format under subsection (2)of Section 11.  is at least 20 and at most 50 per cent of the number of lessons in full-time programmes in each term. Classes are held as follows: in evening programmes, between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on working days and at weekends (Saturday) during the instruction period,  in correspondence programmes, unless otherwise agreed with the students concerned, with the combination of multiple classes, maximum every two weeks, on working days or at weekends (Saturday) and through the use of distance learning methods in the remaining part of the programme; in distance learning programmes, unless otherwise agreed with the students concerned, maximum every three weeks, on working days or at weekends (Saturday).  an opportunity to complete a subject for a student who enrolled in the given subject with a laboratory practice-type course concluded with a mid-term grade in one of the two previous term and met all requirements other than the summative evaluation of learning outcomes even if no course(s) with contact hours were announced for it in the current term. Courses specified in subsection (8) a) and b) have to be announced in every term, while courses specified in c) have to be announced as regulated by the faculty regulations.  [Preferential course schedule] Based on a specific student request, the SCF may consent to a preferential course schedule if a student is not able to meet the relevant academic obligations in the manner defined in this Code and the training programme or their abilities allow them to meet such obligations in a different manner. At a minimum, one of the following criteria must be met to request a preferential course schedule: outstanding academic results and/or participation in talent management programmes, participation in parallel training including international exchange programmes, mobility programmes and other scholarships, demonstration of continuous excellence in studies in combination with outstanding performance of professional activities and/or community activities or public services, active engagement in elite sports at national level, childbirth, childcare and maternity leave, or social and/or health problems. In the decision on preferential course schedule, the SCF may grant – conditional or unconditional –  exemption from mandatory attendance of specific curricular contact hours or certain types of contact hours, an opportunity to take exams and complex exams beyond the examination period,  permission to fulfil specific interim obligations in a manner or schedule different from the one defined in the subject requirement.  The preferential course schedule may in no way mean exemption  from fulfilling obligations defined in the education and outcome requirements as well as the curriculum,  fulfilling preliminary requirements, completing exams, complex exams (or any part thereof) or writing and defending a bachelor or master thesis.  Special criteria of a preferential course schedule may be defined for each subject which will be included in the relevant decision of the SCF.  [Work order of programmes] Programmes under Section 11. may be organised in full-time (daytime), part-time (evening or correspondence), or distance learning format. The preferential subject and course registration period begins at least twelve hours before the preliminary period and ends no sooner than one hour before the start of the preliminary period. Full-time programmes must be organised between 8 a.m and 8 p.m. on working days during weeks including 5 school-days weekly.
