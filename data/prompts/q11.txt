You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Do you only have to take a final examination at the end of the BSc course?
[The final examination] The final examination shall serve to verify and evaluate the knowledge, skills and abilities required for obtaining the degree certificate, during the course of which the students shall also attest that they are capable of applying the knowledge acquired.  Students must take separate finals for each programme, unless otherwise stipulated by law. The final examination will test the students’ synthetised knowledge and will consist of several parts – such as defending the bachelor or master thesis and exams per subject or subject group, as well as final comprehensive examinations – in accordance with the criteria set out in the curriculum. If the bachelor or master thesis is defended in front of the Final Examination Board, the supervisor, thesis advisor and reviewer may be invited to the final examination and will be awarded consultation rights. The final examinations will be organised by the educational organisational unit in charge of the student’s specialisation. If the programme does not have a specialisation, the finals will be organised by the EOU announcing the bachelor or master thesis topic.  Finals may be organised jointly by EOUs, including the EOUs of other institution of higher educations, based on their agreement.  The finals must be held in the language of the programme. If the languages of the programme and the specialisation are different, the finals must be held in the language of the specialisation.  [Criteria for taking the final examination] In bachelor, master, single-cycle and postgraduate specialist training programmes, students finish their studies by taking a final examination. , After obtaining their leaving certificate, students are allowed to take their final examination if the criteria required to issue a leaving certificate prevail three working days prior to the date of the final examination at the latest. The final examination may be taken in the exam period after the leaving certificate (absolutorium) was obtained both within the framework of the student’s legal status and after its expiry within a period of two years in any given exam period in accordance with valid academic requirements.  After the expiration of the second year following the issue of the leaving certificate (absolutorium) students may take their final examinations if the programme owner approves the bachelor thesis subject as currently relevant after consulting with the head of the EOU organising the final examinations and the person in charge of the specialisation (if any). If the topic is deemed to be obsolete, the applicant must write a new bachelor thesis. Final examinations may not be taken after the end of the fifth year following the termination of the student’s legal status.  Students may not take their finals, if they  failed to settle their payment obligations towards the University,  failed to return any equipment owned by the University and previously given to the students for use or failed to submit their bachelor or master thesis by the specified deadline.  [The Final Examination Board] Final examinations are taken in front of a Final Examination Board including a chair and at least two members.  A Final Examination Board must be set up to include at least one university professor or associate professor, at least one member who has no employment relationship with the University or is an instructor at another faculty of the University. The chair of the Final Examination Board  is appointed, on the recommendation of the Dean, by the Faculty Council, and the members are appointed, on the recommendation of the head of the educational organisational unit, by the dean, for a maximum term of three years. Persons not employed by the University as public servants must accept the appointment in writing. In addition to the chair and the members, examiners and the secretary will also be involved in the work of the Final Examination Board.  If only one of the exams in the final examination subjects was unsuccessful, the examinee only has to sit a retake exam in that subject.
