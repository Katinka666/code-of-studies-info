You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: How will my degree certificate result be calculated?
[Classification of the degree certificate] The classification of the degree certificate must be calculated by using the degree certificate result, rounded up to two decimals, as follows: excellent, if the grade is at least 4.50, good, if the grade is at least 3.50, but less than 4.50 satisfactory, if the grade is at least 2.50, but less than 3.50, pass, if the grade is at least 2.00, but less than 2.50. The degree certificate is classified as excellent with distinction, if the examinees have an excellent grade in all subjects of the final examination,  their thesis received an excellent grade in the finals, all their comprehensive exam results, required for the degree certificate (if any) were graded excellent and their cumulative grade point average for the whole study period is at least 4.25.   [Degree certificate result] The result of the degree certificate must be rounded up to two decimals, but partial grades should not be rounded up. The following formulas must be used for the calculation of the degree certificate result: 0.2×AGS+0.3×T+0.3×GPA+0.2×CE if the curriculum also prescribes the completion of comprehensive exam(s) during the studies, 0.2×AGS+0.3×T+0.5×GPA if the curriculum does not prescribe the completion of comprehensive exam(s) during the studies, where CE is the mathematical average of the comprehensive exam grades required for the degree certificate, GPA is the cumulative grade point average for the whole of the study period, while the definitions of AGS and T are applied according to subsection (1) of Section 156.  (2a)  If the training and outcome requirements of the academic programme do not require the completion of a comprehensive examination and a bachelor (master) thesis, the degree certificate result is calculated with the formula 0.5×AGS+0.5×GPA. If students have taken comprehensive exams in more subjects than necessary for the degree certificate, the average of these comprehensive exam grades must be calculated by using the exams with the best grades. If the recommended curriculum prescribes the completion of comprehensive exams for the specialisation of the student, the average must be calculated by using the grades of the comprehensive exams of that specialisation.  Autonomous curricular unit: thematic grouping of subjects which can be completed regularly or occasionally according to the decision of the organisation unit in charge of the given programme. The completion of the programme can be certified by adding an insert to the degree certificate. Specialisation is a unique form of an autonomous curricular unit; Cumulative corrected credit index (CCCI): according to Section 57 (4) of Government Decree 87/2015 (...) The purpose of the cumulative corrected credit index is the quantitative and qualitative assessment of a student’s performance over several terms. The cumulative corrected credit index is calculated the same way as the corrected credit index with the exception that the 30 credits per term and the total of credits undertaken and obtained during the whole period are used for the calculation:  Combined retake or delayed completion option: one-time summative type of the evaluation of learning outcomes that covers the curriculum of the entire term; Passive term: term when the student’s legal status is paused; Parallel legal status: additional legal relationship between the University and the student of another institution of higher education or additional legal relationship between the student of the University and another institution of higher education;  53a. Late completion: the continuation of or the first attempt for a student to take a regular assessment of academic performance which was not started or was started but was not finished, for reasons not attributable to the student; Late completion period: period for retaking or repeating the evaluations of learning outcomes completed in the study period. There are no contact lessons in the late completion period; Project: home assignment for the entire study period, which may also be completed by the students in teamwork; Registration: statement by the enrolled student made in the Study Administration System (SAS) at the start of the term, confirming the start or continuation of studies;  [Classification of the degree certificate] The classification of the degree certificate must be calculated by using the degree certificate result, rounded up to two decimals, as follows: excellent, if the grade is at least 4.50, good, if the grade is at least 3.50, but less than 4.50 satisfactory, if the grade is at least 2.50, but less than 3.50, pass, if the grade is at least 2.00, but less than 2.50. (2a)  If the training and outcome requirements of the academic programme do not require the completion of a comprehensive examination and a bachelor (master) thesis, the degree certificate result is calculated with the formula 0.5×AGS+0.5×GPA. [Degree certificate result] The result of the degree certificate must be rounded up to two decimals, but partial grades should not be rounded up.
