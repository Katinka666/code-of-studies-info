You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Can the instructor say that it is compulsory to attend eighty per cent of the classes in exchange for no third party present at the oral exam?
[Public attendance of assessments of achievement] Written and practical assessments (tests, exams, complex exams etc.) are not open to the public, they may only be attended by students and instructors. Oral assessments – as allowed by the venue of the assessment – may be attended by the University’s instructors and students, however, based on the student’s explicit and reasonable request, public attendance may be restricted by the instructor in case of an assessment and by the chair of the board of examiners in case of a complex exam or final exam. In case of oral assessments, a third person will be present apart from the student and the instructor conducting the assessment who may be a student or an instructor.  [Mid-term grades] ,If a student has not been granted exemption from fulfilling the attendance, participation requirements based on the provisions related to the preferential course schedule or schedule for exceptional students of this Code, due to failure to fulfil the attendance, participation requirements instructors may not deny a mid-term grade if a student has not been absent from more than 20 per cent of the published practical course, in case the absence from the practical course is in excess of 20 per cent but does not exceed 30 per cent, instructors – if allowed by the subject or course requirement – may require the student to complete additional assignments, unless otherwise specified by the subject requirement, instructors will deny a mid-term grade if a student has failed to complete the required laboratory practice including missing the opportunity for late completion. Mid-term grades will be determined based on the combined results of all the assessments of academic achievement taking the following into consideration: the achievement level (points) required to receive a pass (2) grade may not exceed fifty per cent of the level (points) earned by the full and correct completion of all mandatory assessments of achievement, the evaluation will be ‘Not completed’ if a student has failed to complete any of the assessments of academic achievement of a subject (course) or their absence is in excess of the extent allowed by the subject requirement. The process and rules to improve mid-term grades are specified in Title 34 of this Code. If more than two-thirds of the students (at least 10 persons) registering for a subject and taking the assessment for the first time fail at a summative assessment of a compulsory subject announced for a term in a recommended curriculum, which is not a retake or repeat, this must be investigated by the educational organisational unit responsible for teaching the subject, initiated in writing by the Faculty Students’ Union, the instructor or head of the educational organisational unit responsible for teaching the subject. This investigation   [Attendance and participation requirements] Attendance and/or participation at contact lessons may be required in the subject requirements as a condition for obtaining the credits for the subject.  Lectures are an integral part of the academic process and thus the University expects students to attend them. Attendance at lecture-type contact lessons is only compulsory when this is specified as a subject requirement. When attending a lecture is compulsory, the instructor will check the students' attendance at every lecture or in a group of lectures. Checking must be documented (e.g. attendance register, electronic attendance check) and the records of attendance must be retained until the end of the fourth week of instruction in the following term.  As regards lectures, attendance may not be required for more than seventy per cent of the total number of lectures. If absence from the total number of practical and laboratory practice lessons exceeds thirty per cent, the credits for the subject cannot be obtained. Subject requirements may, with the FSC's consent, make obtaining the credits for the subject conditional upon absence of less than this. ,On practical courses and in laboratory practice, the instructor checks participation in the manner and with the regularity specified in the subject requirements. Records documenting participation checks must be retained until the end of the fourth week of instruction in the following term. Language teaching and physical education  In case of oral assessments, a third person will be present apart from the student and the instructor conducting the assessment who may be a student or an instructor. Oral assessments – as allowed by the venue of the assessment – may be attended by the University’s instructors and students, however, based on the student’s explicit and reasonable request, public attendance may be restricted by the instructor in case of an assessment and by the chair of the board of examiners in case of a complex exam or final exam. If at least two-thirds of the students (at least 10 persons) taking the oral (part) exam on the same exam date of a subject announced for a term based on the recommended curriculum – not including repeat and retake (part) exams – fail, this must be investigated, initiated in writing by the Faculty Students’ Union or the head or instructor of the concerned educational organisational unit, within three days following the publication of the results.
