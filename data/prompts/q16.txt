You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Which can I ask for: to be transferred to a self-payed course or to be fired?
 [Conditions of transfer] Persons with a student’s legal status at another institution of higher education or on another programme or training course at the University may request their transfer to a different programme within the same field of study at the University in accordance with the provisions of Government Decree 87/2015.  The transfer request is to be submitted  by an applicant without a student’s legal status at the University through the IT system operated by the Central Academic Office,  by a student of the University in the SAS  addressed to the FSC offering the programme (training). Only students whose student’s legal status has been continuous during the transfer procedure or until enrolment following the transfer decision or until registration may request a transfer. In other cases the University will withdraw its decision on transfer. The applicant may only be transferred to a bachelor training programme and single-cycle training programme – subject to the training capacity and the number of places available – after at least one completed active term provided the applicant has at least an average of eighteen completed credits for each active term, has a cumulative grade point average of a value of at least 2.75, and has satisfied the conditions laid down in the training and outcome requirements and in the Information on Higher Education Admission for the programme the transfer concerns. The applicant may only be transferred to a master training programme – subject to the training capacity and the number of places available – after at least one completed active term provided the applicant has at least an average of eighteen completed credits for each active term, has a cumulative grade point average of a value of at least 3.00, and has satisfied the conditions laid down in the training and outcome requirements and in the Information on Higher Education Admission for the programme the transfer concerns. As regards the provisions of subsection (4) points a)and b), and subsection (5) points a) and b), the faculty may set different requirements for each programme it offers, which it is obliged to publish on the faculty's home page at least six months prior to the earliest possible time for the transfer decision.   [Remedial course] Students, failing to reach the minimum required level in the assessment or failing to participate in an assessment prescribed in Section 47. may be ordered by the faculty in charge of the academic programme (training) to take on and complete a remedial subject.  The completion of the remedial subject pursuant to subsection (1) or the successful completion of the assessment pursuant to Section 47. may be prescribed as a subject prerequisite for another subject with the prior consent of the faculty in charge of the given academic programme (training). A remedial course shall be launched in the next term in a compulsory subject, if the ratio of students successfully completing this subject or an independent course organised in the subject in the term according to the recommended curriculum is less than  sixty per cent in bachelor and single-cycle programmes, seventy percent in the master training programmes. The organisational unit in charge of the subject may also decide to launch a remedial course.   [Transfer procedure] Students submitting a transfer request must attach the following documents to their request some of which are issued by the transferring institution of higher education: confirmation of existing student’s legal status, student register extract, proof of credit recognition for previously completed study units, application for a credit recognition procedure, copy of the documents applicants in the admission process need to submit (school-leaving certificate, degree certificate, language exam certificate, verification of suitability) and the classification decision and the admission decision. In a transfer procedure within the University, the applicant only needs to submit the document listed in point d) of subsection (1). The FSC acts in assessing transfer requests at first instance and the Credit Transfer Committee is responsible for conducting the credit recognition procedure based on an application submitted as an attachment to the transfer request. In case of transfers, the student’s legal status at the previous academic programme is terminated, one day prior to the enrolment to the new programme (training) related to the transfer. The resolution on the transfer must determine the financing form of the training. The period open for transfer, change of programme, change of training location, language of instruction or study mode is from the end of the previous study period until 15 September for the autumn term and until 15 February for the spring term. A transfer request must be submitted by 15 July at the latest for the autumn term and by 30 January at the latest for the spring term.  Students who were receiving full or partial scholarship from the Hungarian state and withdrew their declaration, stipulated by subsection (2) of Section 48/D of the Higher Education Act, by registering such withdrawal in the SAS, shall be reclassified to self-financed status. The resolution on the transfer must determine the financing form of the training. Under subsection (2) of Section 82 of the Higher Education Act students are obliged to pay a separate fee per course for re-registering for a course in any subject previously registered for but not completed for any reason.
