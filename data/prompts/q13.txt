You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Is there a second retake midterm exam for each subject, and can it be held on the day after the retake midterm exam?
independently for each assessment of achievement [individual retake, repeat or late completion] or in an aggregate manner for all assessments of achievement [combined retake, repeat or late completion] at retake, repeat or late completion occasions published for the study or late completion period. Individual retake, repeat or late completions cover the same body of knowledge and are based on the same methodology as the assessment of achievement retaken or completed after the due date. Combined retake, repeat or late completions are subject to the consent of the FSC responsible for the programme (training). If repeat or late completion of any groups of assessments of academic achievement is prohibited by any provision of the subject requirement, the (partial) result for these groups of assessments will be based on the most favourable two-third – rounded down – for the specific student. Late completion defined in point a) of subsection (5)will be held in the late completion period if it may not be scheduled for the study period due to the deadline specified in subsection (4)of Section 127. ,,If specifically allowed by the subject requirement, a retake, repeat or late completion of summative assessments is allowed for a second time upon payment of a special charge defined in this Code. Second retakes, repeat completions are organised as defined in subsection (5) and are required to be completed until the third day of the exam period. The educational organisational unit must allow access to a second retake or repeat completion if less than two-thirds of the students participating in the previous summative assessments earned a ‘Signed’ mark or a mid-term grade better than fail. Second retakes or repeat completions of summative assessments will be published via the SAS as special exam dates defined in other regulations and students must register for them according to the rules of exam registration. No grades, results will be recorded for exam dates published as described above. Students are only allowed to participate in second retakes or repeat completions of summative assessments if they have participated in the assessment or its first retake, repeat or late completion.  [General rules regarding retakes, repeat and late completion] The University provides an opportunity for each student to demonstrate their knowledge and repeat their successful or unsuccessful assessment of academic achievement ensuring unbiased execution and evaluation of the repeated assessment of achievement. ,Students will be denied the opportunity for a retake, repeat or late completion if  in case of mid-term assessments of the subject, they have failed to meet the attendance and/or participation requirements defined in this Code or in the subject requirement; or the opportunity is excluded by the provisions in Title 38. Unless otherwise specified by this Code, the first occasion published by the educational organisational unit for repeat or late completion of the assessment of academic achievement will be available free of charge for students. Unless otherwise specified by the subject requirement and this Code, in case of repeat completion of the assessment, the result of the repeat completion will be considered. The opportunities for retakes, repeat or late completion related to mid-term assessments will be planned to ensure that students using the opportunities in subsections (1) to (5) of Section 122. and meeting the required criteria may receive a different grade than fail as their mid-term grade and/or may receive a ‘Signed’ mark in subjects concluded with an exam.  [Exams] Exams are a form of assessment of achievement of specific learning outcomes related to a single subject, completed – in whole or in part – in the exam period. Exams may comprise an oral assessment, a written assessment, the completion of practical exercises, the complete or partial inclusion of the results of mid-term assessments of academic achievement or of a group of such assessments or the combination of any of the above parts. Exams may be single or combined. Single exams include only one while combined exams include at least two of the parts defined in subsection (2). The subject requirement defines which parts from subsection (2) will be included in a specific combined exam, with the restriction that the number of exam components and parts of an exam may not exceed three, the order in which the parts are required to be completed, what minimum performance criteria in each part are required to successfully pass the exam, how specific groups of interim assessments of achievement will be included in the exam result and if specific parts are allowed to be separately retaken or repeated with the purpose to improve the result. All parts of a combined exam are required to be completed in the same term, however specific parts may be completed on different days. An exam failed for any reason – including any failed part of an exam with the exception of the part in point d) of subsection (2) – reduces the number of exams available to a student by one. In case of the partial inclusion of mid-term results, the part of an exam taken during the exam period will be incorporated in the exam grade minimally at a rate of fifty per cent and the results achieved in the study period incorporated in the exam grade – unless otherwise specified in the subject requirement – will be incorporated in all terms for which a ‘Signed’ mark has been granted. The complete inclusion of mid-term results means that the exam grade is entirely based on a student’s interim achievements. In such cases, students will be allowed to modify the grade received in the above described manner in an exam taken in the exam period as specified by the subject requirement.  Second retakes, repeat completions are organised as defined in subsection (5) and are required to be completed until the third day of the exam period. A third and any subsequent retake exam in the same subject is considered the same as a repeated retake exam, irrespective of the term it is taken in and will be subject to a fee; 22a. The opportunities for retakes, repeat or late completion related to mid-term assessments will be planned to ensure that students using the opportunities in subsections (1) to (5) of Section 122. and meeting the required criteria may receive a different grade than fail as their mid-term grade and/or may receive a ‘Signed’ mark in subjects concluded with an exam.
