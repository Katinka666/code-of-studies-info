You will be given some extract from the university's code of studies, and your task is to answer a student's question based on it. The question: Are there negative consequences if I borrow a memory card from the university and do not return it?
[Dismissal by reason of payment arrears] The University will unilaterally terminate the student's legal status in a particular programme due to payment arrears if calling upon the student to settle them was without effect and the University, at the student's request, has examined the student's social situation. The day of terminating the legal relationship is the day the decision on termination becomes final. ,The University calls upon the student in a message sent in the SAS within eight days of the expiry of the payment deadline, specifying a sixty-day period of grace, to settle the payment arrears, or to apply for an option to pay in instalments or to change the payment deadline due to the student's social situation – with the exception of the fees imposed pursuant to subsection (5) of Section 4 of Government Decree 51/2007, and at the same time draws attention to the legal consequences of failure to pay. If the student is still in arrears with payment after the expiry of the period of grace given in the notice and the student has not submitted an application for payment in instalments or for changing the payment deadline within this period, the student's legal status will be terminated on the day following the expiry of the period of grace. If the student has submitted an application for payment in instalments or for changing the payment deadline but the application is rejected, the legal status will be terminated on the day the decision rejecting the application becomes final but on the first day following the expiry of the period of grace at the earliest. The student's social situation will be examined by the Social Committee within the University's Unified Social System.  If a student obtains knowledge of information classified as confidential whose disclosure would infringe the personal rights of others (in particular but not exclusively information that may infringe the human dignity of or abuse the trust of people who are ill or disabled, or information that is classified as confidential for another reason), such information must be kept secret. If the obligation of confidentiality is infringed, the student concerned will bear the legal consequences of this. Students with overdue payment obligations to the University (payment arrears) may not enrol, register for an active term, take a course, register for an examination (complex exam).  At the request of the student, the University shall make the documents issued by it available to the student in an electronically authenticated form via the SAS.

If a student does not fulfil an existing payment obligation towards the University by 23:59 on the penultimate working day of the registration period or does not submit a request to postpone payment by the same deadline, the student's legal status will be suspended in the given academic period.

During the period of suspension, the student is not entitled to free services and student's allowances with the exception of the use of the library and, in the entire period of the subject and course registration, the use of the computer room.  Students are not obliged to make the notification but they are liable for any legal consequences arising from failure to do so.
