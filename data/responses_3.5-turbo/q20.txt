The main difference between an exam and a mid-term exam lies in the timing and scope of assessment. An exam is a form of assessment completed during the exam period and can include various components such as oral assessments, written assessments, practical exercises, or a combination of these. On the other hand, a mid-term exam is specifically a written summative evaluation of learning outcomes that is taken in a controlled environment under the supervision of an instructor and typically has a completion time frame of 30 minutes or more. 

In summary, while exams can encompass a broader range of assessment methods and are usually completed at the end of a term or course, mid-term exams are specifically focused on written evaluations and are conducted in the middle of a term or course.
