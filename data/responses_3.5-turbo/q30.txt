The fact that everyone received an A in Probability does not necessarily indicate suspicion or wrongdoing. Grades are typically determined based on the assessment of a student's performance and understanding of the subject matter, as outlined in the university's code of studies. It is possible that all students performed exceptionally well in the Probability course, leading to the high number of A grades. Additionally, the university may have rigorous standards and criteria for grading that result in a higher proportion of top grades being awarded in certain courses. If you have any concerns about the grading process, you may refer to the university's policies on appeals and decision-making procedures to address any issues or seek clarification.
